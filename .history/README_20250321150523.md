# RILaST - Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search Based Testing of Autonomous Robotic Systems

<p align="center">
  <b>Current Tool Version: 1.0.</b>
</p>

We propose RILaST (Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing) approach, which enhances test representation by mapping it to the latent space of a variational autoencoder. We evaluate RILaST on two use cases, including autonomous drone and autonomous lane-keeping assist systems. The obtained results show that RILaST allows finding between 3 to 4.6 times more failures than baseline approaches, achieving a high level of test diversity.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies. This project uses Python 3.9 and conda package manager.
```
git clone git@github.com:swat-lab-optimization/RILaST.git
cd RILaST
conda create -n rilast python=3.9
conda activate RILaST
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Framework overview
One of the main components you should define in the context of Rilast is a ```TestGenerator``` class. This class should implement only one ```initialize_problem``` method, that defines the class that actually generates the tests (based )
