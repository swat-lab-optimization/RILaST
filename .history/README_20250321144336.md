# RILaST - Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search Based Testing of Autonomous Robotic Systems

<p align="center">
  <b>Current Tool Version: 1.0.</b>
</p>

We propose RILaST (Representation Improvement in Latent Space for Search-Based Testing) approach, which enhances test representation by mapping it to the latent space of a variational autoencoder. We evaluate RILaST on two use cases, including autonomous drone and autonomous lane-keeping assist systems. The obtained results show that RILaST allows finding between 3 to 4.6 times more failures than baseline approaches, achieving a high level of test diversity.
